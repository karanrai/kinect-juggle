==General Info===
The code has been tested on a windows7 64-bit system compiled with Visual Studio 2010.

The SensorKinect driver is currently 32-bit only so the Primesense and OpenNI binaries you download should also be 32 bit even if have a 64-bit system.

If you already have open kinect installed you need to uninstall it from device manager. Make sure to click the option to completely remove the driver files or windows will try and put it back and SensorKinect won't work. 

Any comments, sugesstions or further info please get in touch.
